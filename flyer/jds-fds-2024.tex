The Journal of Data Science (JDS) (\url{http://jds-online.org})
invites submissions for a special issue of ``Statistical Frontiers of
Data Science.''  This initiative follows the
\href{https://statds.org/events/ifods2024}{International Forum on Data
  Science (IFoDS) 2024}, set to take place on July 21, 2024, at
Renmin University of China, Beijing, China. The forum, hosted by the
School of Statistics and the Center for Applied Statistics at Renmin
University, aims to meld the theoretical and practical realms of data
science.


This special issue pays tribute to Prof. Xizhi Wu, whose contributions
have profoundly shaped the landscape of statistics and data science in
China. Prof. Wu's illustrious career spans several prestigious institutions,
including Nankai
University, Peking University, Renmin University of China, and Sun
Yat-Sen University. He was a pioneer in integrating modern statistical
computing into the curriculum, significantly elevating the role of
data science within statistical education across the
nation. Prof. Wu's visionary efforts have not only transformed the
academic field but also inspired a generation of scholars in
China. Many of his students and mentees have emerged as international
leaders in statistics and data science, further testament to his
remarkable influence. Prof. Wu's enduring legacy continues to guide
and inspire the evolution of these disciplines within China and
beyond.


We welcome submissions that spotlight the latest developments in data
science, particularly those closely related to statistics. Suitable
topics encompass a wide array, including artificial intelligence,
bioinformatics, clinical trials, data curation, machine learning,
statistical computing, and applications across various domains reliant
on data. This call is open to all, not just IFoDS participants, and
submissions may target any JDS section, such as Philosophy of Data
Science, Statistical Data Science, Computing in Data Science, Data
Science in Action, Data Science Review, Education in Data Science, and
Data Science Conversation.


Submissions should consist of original, unpublished work not under
consideration elsewhere. They will undergo a swift, regular review
process, with accepted manuscripts published online promptly.



To submit, please visit
\url{https://www.e-publications.org/ruc/sbs/JDS/login} and indicate
the special issue in your cover letter.


Since 2003, the Journal of Data Science has published research on a
wide range of topics involving the understanding and effective use of
field data. The journal underwent a reform in July 2020 to better serve
the data science community in the era of data science. Attractive
features of the journal include completely free access, fast review
times, and a focus on reproducible data science.
