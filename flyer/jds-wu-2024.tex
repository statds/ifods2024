The Journal of Data Science (JDS) (\url{http://jds-online.org}) invites submissions for a special issue titled ``New Frontiers of Data Science: Honoring Prof. Xizhi Wu's Impact and Vision." Prof. Wu's pioneering work and visionary thinking have significantly shaped the landscape of data science. In honor of Prof. Wu's impact and vision in both data science education and research, this special issue seeks to highlight the latest and most significant advancements in the field. We warmly invite contributions that introduce innovative methodologies and applications within data science. This call for papers is open to submissions across all sections of JDS, including Philosophy of Data Science, Statistical Data Science, Computing in Data Science, Data Science in Action, Data Science Review, Education in Data Science, and Data Science Conversation. 
\\

JDS is sponsored by the School of Statistics at Renmin University of China and the Center for Applied Statistics of Renmin University of China - the Key Research Institute of the China Ministry of Education in Humanities and Social Sciences. With the aim to better support the development of data science, JDS emphasizes the field's three critical dimensions: computer science, statistics, and the latest advancements in application areas. Since 2003, the Journal of Data Science has published research on a wide range of topics involving the understanding and effective use of field data. The journal underwent reform in July 2020 to better serve
the data science community in the era of data science. Attractive features of the journal include completely free access, fast review times, and a focus on reproducible data science.
