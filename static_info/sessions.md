### Session 1: Korey Stringer organized session

#### Cumulative Impact Load, Injury and Cartilage Metabolism in Collegiate Women’s Basketball Athletes 

##### Julie Burland, University of Connecticut

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Purpose: Impact loading alterations have been associated with cartilage metabolism changes before and after joint injury; however, the relationship and variation in these metrics over an athletic season is unclear. We aimed to establish whether cumulative impact load and serum biomarkers are related to lower extremity injury and evaluate any impact load and cartilage biomarker relationships. 
Methods: Eleven collegiate women’s basketball athletes (height:1.86 meters, mass:82.0 kilograms, age:20.54 years) participated in a prospective case-series evaluating lower extremity impact load, serum cartilage biomarkers, and injury incidence. Cartilage synthesis (CPII, CS846) and degradation (C2C) biomarkers were evaluated at 6 season timepoints. Impact load metrics (cumulative bone stimulus, impact intensity) were collected during practices using inertial measurement units secured to the distal medial tibiae. Injury was defined as restriction of participation for 1 or more days beyond day of initial injury. Cumulative impact load metrics were calculated over the week prior to any documented injury and blood draws for analysis. Point biserial and Pearson product moment correlations were utilized to determine the relationship between impact load metrics, serum biomarkers, and injury.
Results: Greater medium range (6-20g’s) cumulative impact intensities during week 5 for both limbs (r=0.674, p=0.023) and high range (20-200g’s) during week 8 for both limbs (0.672, p=0.024) were associated with injury. Greater cumulative bone stimulus was associated with increased CPII levels in the post-season for right (r=0.694, p=0.026) and left (r=0.747, p=0.013) limbs. Greater CS846 levels at off-season-1 (r=0.729, p=0.017), and at the beginning of the competitive season (r=0.645, p=0.044) were associated with season long injury incidence. Conclusions: Higher impact intensities (6-200g’s) early in the season were associated with subsequent injury. Increased cartilage synthesis at various timepoints was related to increased cumulative bone stimulus metrics and season-long injury incidence. These relationships should be further evaluated to determine predictive capabilities in larger cohorts. 

#### Integration of Technology and Tracking Performance Metrics In Division I Women’s Basketball Players 

##### Andrea Hudy, UConn Athletics

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The integration of technology in sport has significantly advanced over the last decade. Technology and player monitoring has allowed us to make more informed decisions as it pertains to health and physical performance. Monitoring is used to optimize physical performance and stress with the intention of prescribing training load, reducing risks, and identifying fatigue. Widespread understanding, adoption, and application of these practices is severely lacking in elite collegiate women’s basketball. The technologies highlighted in this presentation include player load management using the Catapult System and neuromuscular responses using force plate technology by Sparta Science. The purpose of this session is to describe the technology we use and how we monitor workload and neuromuscular response. Furthermore, this presentation will share experiences related to technology integration and player monitoring with the intention of optimizing performance. Examples of unique cases where technology was able to detect subtle changes in these metrics will be examined in depth. The application of this data in the future for women’s basketball has endless potential. 

#### Swim Tuff: A Record Breaking Swim 

##### David Martin, Korey Stringer Institute

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Ultra-marathon open water swimming (OWS) events are one of the toughest endurance challenges in the world. The sport has gained notoriety with athletes swimming across the English Channel, Diana Nyad swimming from Cuba to Florida, and the 5 and 10km OWS in the Olympic schedule. The athletes who participate are exposed to dangerous conditions that expose risks inherent to the sport. The optimal time to prepare for an emergency is before it happens. The aim of this session is to present the emergency action plan (EAP) designed for the “Swim Tuff” event, a record-breaking ultramarathon swim that took place in Rhode Island, USA.  We will also present physiological data recorded from the event. This session identifies an overview of Swim Tuff, the challenges experienced, and how the team designed and implemented risk mitigation strategies. 

#### Monitoring training load between in-season periods for an elite D1 NCAA women’s basketball team 

##### John Navarro, University of Connecticut

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The demands of intense training and rigorous game schedule may result in decreased performance, increased fatigue, and increase injury risk in women’s NCAA Division I basketball. Wearable technology provides quantifiable insights on a team’s training load that can be used to optimize exercise stress, response, and adaptation to optimize performance. PURPOSE: To investigate the fluctuations in measures of external load between the four essential periods (Pre-Season, Non-Conference, Conference, and Post-Season) in a women’s basketball team. METHODS: 15 elite NCAA women’s basketball players were monitored via Catapult's S7 inertial measurement units (IMU) during practice and game days. Weekly total PlayerLoad? (PL), PL?min-1 (PLM), and total jumps (TJ) means were collected and exported using OpenField Software (Catapult) then transferred to Tableau. A one-way ANOVA was used to detect significant differences (p?<?0.05) in measures of external load across periods. Additionally, we conducted Tukey’s HSD post-hoc tests to identify pairwise differences between periods. RESULTS: We observed a significant difference in PL between the Pre-Season and Conference periods (MD -186.85, 95% CI [-353.21, -20.49],  p = 0.02). There were no significant differences in PLM and TJ between all four periods (p?>?0.05); however, Pre-Season averaged the highest total PL, PLM, TJ compared to all other periods. PLPM was highest in the Pre-Season compared to all other periods (vs. Non-Conference (MD -0.66, 95% CI [-1.76, 0.44] , vs Conference (MD -0.50, 95% CI [-1.63, 0.63], vs. Post-Season (MD -0.60, 95% CI [-1.74, 0.54]). TJ was also highest in the Pre-Season compared to all other periods (vs. Non-Conference (MD -8.29, 95% CI -30.26, 13.67] , vs. Conference (MD -10.59, 95% CI -33.34, 12.14], vs. Post-Season (MD -5.29, 95% CI -28.03, 17.45). CONCLUSION: While our study is ongoing, the findings for the 2022 – 2023 season suggest PL demands are highest during the Pre-Season period of the D1 NCAA women’s basketball season. Our findings suggest that modifications to pre-season are warranted. Periodization of training load though the modification of acute program variables would allow for optimal adaptation and performance prior to the start of the non-conference period. With optimal management, both physical performance and injury risk may be optimized within this NCAA women’s basketball team.

### Session 2: Olympic Sports

#### Four (three) years later: A look back at the sport climbing competition format and scoring system at Tokyo 2020 (2021) 

##### Gregory J. Matthews, Department of Mathematics and Statistics, Loyola University Chicago

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Sport climbing, which made its Olympic debut at the 2020 Summer Games in Tokyo, generally consists of three separate disciplines: speed climbing, bouldering, and lead climbing. However, the International Olympic Committee only allowed one set of medals each for men and women in sport climbing at Tokyo 2020. As a result, the governing body of sport climbing, rather than choosing only one of the three disciplines for the 2020 Summer Olympics, decided to create a competition combining all three disciplines. In order to determine a winner, a combined scoring system was created using the product of the ranks across the three disciplines to determine an overall score for each climber. In this work, the rank-product scoring system of sport climbing is evaluated through simulation to investigate its general features, specifically, the advancement probabilities and scores for climbers given certain placements. Additionally, analyses of historical climbing results are presented and real examples of violations of the independence of irrelevant alternatives are illustrated. Finally, this work finds evidence that the competition format at Tokyo 2020 is putting speed climbers at a disadvantage. 

#### Athlete Recruitment and the Myth of the Sophomore Peak 

##### Monnie McGee, Southern Methodist University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Conventional wisdom dispersed by fans and coaches in the stands at almost any high school track meet suggests female athletes typically peak around 10th grade or earlier (15 years of age), particularly for distance runners, and male athletes continuously improve. Given that universities in the United States typically recruit
track and field athletes from high school teams, it is important to understand the age of peak performance at the high school level. Athletes are often recruited starting in their sophomore year of high school and individuals develop at different rates during adolescence; however, the individual development factor is
usually not taken into account during recruitment. In this study, we curate data on event times for high school track and field athletes from the years 2011 to 2019 to determine the trajectory of fastest times for male and female athletes in the 200m, 400m, 800m, and 1600m races. We show, through visualizations and models, that, for most athletes, the sophomore peak is a myth. Performance is mostly dependent on the individual athlete. That said, the trajectories cluster into four or five types, depending on the race distance. We explain the significance of the types for future recruitment. 

#### Optimizing Team Selection & Strategy for the Swimming Mixed Medley Relay 

##### Lulu Zheng, Yale University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Despite having some of the world’s best swimmers, the US placed 5th in the 4x100 mixed medley relay at the 2021 Tokyo Summer Olympics. Articles came out after the event criticizing the United States’ strategy and lineup for the relay, so this project aims to pin down the optimal relay combination for the 4x100 mixed medley relay for the United States at the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics. Coming directly from the US Olympic Committee, the data used in this project include individual swim data for the 100 back, 100 breast, 100 free, and 100 fly events for men and women from 2016 to 2022. The first portion of the analysis fits a multiple linear regression model for each of the eight swim events, with the predictors in each model consisting of the swimmer age, session description, meet type, relay indicator, swim meet year, and unique swimmer ID, and the outcome variable being swim time in seconds. The results of the models confirm an age curve for swimmers and indicate that swimmers tend to swim faster in finals and Olympic Games compared to prelims and Olympic Trials. The second portion of the analysis uses the models to predict swim times for the 2021 and 2024 Olympics, constructs normal distributions for the swimmers based on their predicted swim times, and uses the normal distributions to simulate individual swim times & relay times for different combinations of the fastest swimmers in each country. The simulation results reveal that the US used their 61st predicted fastest relay combination for the mixed medley, potentially explaining their mediocre medley ranking in the 2021 Tokyo Olympics. Additionally, based on the simulation results, our recommended fastest relay combination for the US would have Regan Smith swimming back, Michael Andrew swimming breast, Caeleb Dressel swimming fly, and Simone Manuel swimming free in the 2024 Paris Olympics, assuming the aforementioned swimmers are able to participate. These results are further summarized in a web application designed to help coaches select their optimal relay team.

#### Spatial Distributions for End-of-Play Outcomes in American Football 

##### Nick Bachelder, Duke University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> In American football, predicting end-of-play location is crucial to the creation of commonly referenced player-evaluation metrics such as Yards Over Expected (YOE). However, most existing models in this domain primarily focus on predicting only point estimates for gained downfield yardage. While these models are ideal for metric creation and simplicity, they fail to estimate the probability distributions behind outcomes, thereby neglecting to explore the potential for multi-modal end-of-play possibilities. Moreover, while estimating only downfield yardage is sufficient for yardage-gained metrics, it fails to provide insight into how players influence play outcomes across the entire field.

I propose a method that leverages an ensemble of Deep Convolutional Gaussian Mixture Models (DCGMM) to address these limitations. This approach (1) estimates the end-of-play location as a two-dimensional mixture distribution, encompassing outcomes in both downfield and lateral field directions, and (2) allows for the employment of the subtraction method to analyze how estimated end-of-play distributions change with and without certain players. Through such modeling, I also estimate appropriate model error with bootstrap ensembling to account for the limitations of tracking data sample sizes. This research enables a more comprehensive and visual understanding of how player positioning affects influence over the field. 

#### Fractional tackles 

##### Quang Nguyen, Department of Statistics & Data Science, Carnegie Mellon University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Tackle is a fundamental defensive move in American football, with the main purpose of stopping the forward progress of the ball carrier. However, current tackling metrics are mostly observed outcomes at the play-level, hence inherently flawed due to their discrete nature. Using player tracking data, we present a model-free framework for assessing tackling contribution throughout a play. Our approach first identifies when a defender is in a contact window of the ball carrier during a play, before assigning values to each window and the players involved. Importantly, we devise a novel statistic, called fractional tackles, which properly credits defenders for halting the ball carrier’s momentum in the end zone direction. This overcomes the shortcomings of previous metrics like tackles and assists, which overstate a defender’s tackling contribution as suggested by our results. Furthermore, we analyze the variation of our statistic across different positions and over time. We also display the top NFL defenders based on our metric for the first nine weeks of the 2022 regular season.

#### A New Framework to Estimate Return on Investment for Player Salaries in the National Basketball Association 

##### Jackson Lautier, Bentley University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> The evaluation of financial investment decisions always begins with a measurement of realized returns. Difficulties arise when returns are nonmonetary, however.  One such example is offering a monetary salary in exchange for playing basketball, such as in the National Basketball Association.  Despite many proposals to measure the on-court performance of basketball players, there are very few studies that consider both salary and on-court performance simultaneously.  We thus present a novel five-part framework to translate a basketball player’s on-court performance into a series of cash flows for the purpose of estimating a contractual return on investment (ROI).  Our framework relies on a novel performance-based per-game wealth redistribution measurement that is calibrated with logistic regression on player tracking data against team wins, a WinLogit. The cumulative nature of player statistics into team statistics directly leads to pleasing statistical properties, such as the sum of player game logits equating to the team’s game logit.  We also find a maximum likelihood estimate for the WinLogit.  We further demonstrate that centered player statistics allow for player calculations to be directly normalized to an average or replacement player, often desirable in sports analysis.  We find WinLogit is more accurate than a per-game version of Win Score and Game Score at estimating team total wins and relative team rankings.  We present ROI calculations based on WinLogit, Win Score, and Game Score.  All results are presented for the 2022-2023 NBA regular season, including by position.  For the purposes of replication, all data and code have been made available on a public repository. 

#### Estimating the age-conditioned average treatment effects curves: An application for assessing load-management strategies in the NBA 

##### Shinpei Nakamura Sakai, Yale University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> In the realm of competitive sports, athletes' performance trajectories are typically characterized by an "age curve," exhibiting progression, peak performance, and eventual decline. These curves are anticipated to exhibit variability based on the unique attributes of each athlete. Despite its critical importance, there has been scant research on the variability of treatment effects across different ages. Addressing this gap, our study introduces a novel analytical framework that quantifies the treatment effect for individual ages, thereby delineating the age-specific treatment effect curve.

Our research makes three pivotal contributions. Firstly, we establish a Conditional Expectation Function (CEF) that enables a comparative analysis of age curves across diverse covariates and treatment modalities. Secondly, we advance a causal inference methodology that facilitates the construction of an Age-Conditioned Treatment Effect (ACTE) for any given intervention, allowing for the testing of causal hypotheses specific to each age regarding the treatment and its consequent outcomes. Lastly, we implement our method to evaluate the impact of rest days between games on various performance indicators, taking into account the age of the athletes. 

#### Empirical Determination of Baseball Eras: Multivariate Changepoint Analysis in Major League Baseball 

##### Mena Whalen, Loyola University Chicago

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Multivariate change point analysis methods are used to identify not only mean shifts but also changes in variance across a wide array of statistical time series in Major League Baseball. The primary objective is to discern distinct eras in the evolution of baseball, shedding light on significant transformations in team performance and management strategies. Results confirm previous research, pinpointing well-known baseball eras, such as the Dead Ball Era, Integration Era, Steroid Era, and Post-Steroid Era. Moreover, the study delves into the detection of substantial changes in team performance, effectively identifying periods of both dynasties and collapses within a team's history. The multivariate change point analysis proves to be a valuable tool for understanding the intricate dynamics of baseball's evolution. The method offers a data-driven approach to unveil structural shifts in the sport's historical landscape, providing fresh insights into the impact of rule changes, player strategies, and external factors on baseball's evolution. 

#### Parametric outline fitting to track the evolution of the called strike zone in Major League Baseball from 2008-2023 

##### Dale Zimmerman, University of Iowa

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Although the strike zone is rigorously defined by Major League Baseball’s official rules, umpires make mistakes in calling pitches as strikes (and balls) and may even adhere to a strike zone somewhat different than that prescribed by the rule book. The availability of data from the automated pitch tracking systems known as PITCHf/x (2008—2016) and TrackMan (2017—2023) makes it possible to answer interesting questions about this “called strike zone” (CSZ).  I develop methods for using these data to make inferences about the evolution of geometric attributes (centroid, dimensions, orientation and shape) of the CSZ over time. The methodology consists of first using kernel discriminant analysis to determine a noisy outline representing the CSZ for each year, then fitting generalized superelliptic (GSE) models for closed curves to that outline, and finally applying Mann-Kendall tests for monotonic trend to the estimated parameters of the GSE models. I apply these methods to PITCHf/x and TrackMan data comprising about five million called pitches from the 2008–2023  Major League Baseball seasons to study how the CSZ evolved over this time period. I find that most, but not all, geometric attributes of the CSZ became significantly more like those of the rule-book strike zone from 2008–2023.

#### Understanding the Effects of the 2023 Major League Baseball Rule Changes 

##### Ryan Feder, The Dalton School

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Rule changes in Major League Baseball (MLB) are uncommon compared to other sports like basketball and football, especially ones which completely change a certain aspect of the game. At the start of the 2023 season, MLB instituted a set of three significant rule changes: the introduction of a pitch clock with a corresponding limit on the number of pickoff attempts per plate appearance, an increase in the size of the bases, and a ban on certain defensive alignments (banning the shift). This project aims to determine how much of an impact these three rule changes actually had on the various aspects of gameplay and associated outcomes. Other than reducing the length of games, did the pitch clock change league wide trends in statistics like ERA, or did it only help or hurt certain pitchers? How much did base stealing change throughout the year, and did pitchers eventually adjust to better control the running game? Initial results suggest that although the pitch clock may not have had a significant impact across the league, certain pitchers who took longer between pitches during the 2022 MLB season fared worse once the pitch clock was introduced. Furthermore, findings suggest that the 2023 season marked a significant change in league-wide trends across various baserunning outcomes. Though a three inch change in the size of the bases may seem insignificant, in tandem with pitch clock and pickoff rules, the new rule changes shifted how MLB teams approach stealing bases and their success in doing so. 

#### On Devon Allen's Disqualification at the 2022 World Track and Field  Championships 

##### Owen Fiore, Uconn Masters in Data Science

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Devon Allen was disqualified in the men's 110 meter hurdle final of the 2022
World Track and Field Championships after registering a reaction time of 0.099 
seconds, 0.001 seconds faster than what is allowed. Following the games, 
bloggers on the running website LetsRun concluded that the reaction times  
from the 2022 World Championships seemed to be generally faster compared to the other reaction times they considered, but they did not perform any formal 
statistical analysis. This paper questions if athletes who competed at the 2022
World Track and Field Championship had similar times at other competitions and if 0.1 seconds is a reasonable disqualification barrier. To do so, we employ a 
signed-rank test for clustered data to compare reaction times for the same 
athletes at different competitions and a generalized linear mixed model 
with random venue (year) effect and a random heat effect within venue 
in order to model the reaction time data. This matter needs to be addressed 
because disqualification based on allowable reaction time will continue to be an
issue in future world championships. 

#### Predicting Injuries through Pose Estimation: A Biomechanical Analysis of Fatigue in Track and Field Athletes 

##### Daniel Griffiths, Syracuse University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study introduces a pose estimation model, leveraging artificial intelligence and computer vision, to analyze biomechanical changes in track and field athletes due to fatigue. The primary aim was to investigate how fatigue influences athletes' movement patterns, potentially leading to injuries and performance degradation. The method involved capturing videos from a lateral (side) view and an anterior (front) view as athletes ran five laps (1.25 miles) at a mile race pace (around 5:40 per mile for this athlete) on a standard Olympic track. The hypothesis was that athletes would exhibit signs of fatigue by the final lap, impacting their biomechanical efficiency. Using the OpenPose model, the research extracted x and y coordinates from athletes' movements during different laps, facilitating a detailed kinematic analysis. This included examining joint correlations, ankle positions, cyclical asymmetry, posture analysis, and stride lengths across laps. The results showed notable shifts in joint correlations, particularly between the ankles and shoulders, and the knees and shoulders, indicating compensatory movements due to fatigue. Ankle positions demonstrated increasing consistency, suggesting an adaptation in running technique to counteract fatigue. Additionally, variations in the cyclical asymmetry index and forward lean angles further pointed towards fatigue-induced changes in knee movement and posture. These findings were complemented by a decrease in average step length across laps, highlighting a shift to more sustainable running patterns as fatigue set in. Temporal consistency scores improved over time, implying that athletes maintained stable movement patterns despite fatigue. This suggests a high level of adaptability in the athletes’ biomechanical strategies to cope with the increasing physical demands of the task. This research highlights the potential of AI-driven pose estimation in sports science, offering valuable insights for enhancing training plans, preventing overtraining, optimizing peaking for later competitions, and reducing injury risks in athletics. It underscores the importance of continuous monitoring of athletes' biomechanics, not just in competition but also during training. By integrating AI and computer vision into sports science, coaches and athletes gain access to a powerful tool for real-time biomechanical analysis, enabling more informed decisions to enhance performance and prevent injuries. This study paves the way for more sophisticated and personalized training programs, tailored to the individual biomechanical profiles and fatigue responses of athletes. 

#### Quantitative Analysis of Mental Resilience and Scoring in Tennis 

##### Shihao Li, Yale University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This paper aims to investigate whether mental pressure has an impact on point win probability and performance metrics at the highest level of tennis. Tennis is structured such that certain points are more impactful to the match outcome than other points, providing the perfect setting to investigate the impact of mental resiliency in sports. We use point-by-point data from the 2019 Grand Slam tournaments provided by Jack Sackmann, which includes metrics like serving performance, rally performance, scores, and outcomes, to identify high
pressure points. We then trained linear and logistic mixed effect regression models of win probability and key metrics to evaluate the effect of mental pressure while controlling for other factors in the match. We additionally compared model accuracy depending on the use of player random slopes with respect to point pressure, allowing us to evaluate whether differences in individual ability to play under pressure are meaningful in determining match outcomes between two players. We find that, on average, mental pressure has a small but directionally negative effect on win probability and performance metrics. There is, however, little to no benefit to model accuracy from including player random slopes with pressure, suggesting that pressure does not affect one player in the data particularly more than others. As such, professional tennis match outcomes
are not significantly influenced by a difference in mental resiliency between the players of that match. 

#### Examining regional and familiarity bias of referees in USA Fencing Division 1 bouts 

##### Rivka Lipkovitz, Proof School

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This study investigates whether USA Fencing referees exhibit favoritism towards competitors from the same designated regions, as they frequently officiate bouts involving fencers in their respective areas. This regular pairing establishes familiarity, which may lead to unconsciously biased officiating as suggested by prior research. This is particularly relevant in foil and saber, where simultaneous hits require subjective judgement calls on "right-of-way" to determine who scores the point. Furthermore, penalty decisions also hold potential for bias in epee. Unlike other sports with subjective scoring, fencing relies solely on a single referee, granting them substantial control over scoring. Analyzing a seven-year dataset (2012-2019) of 33,555 Division 1 pool bouts and using multiple linear regression to control for fencer skill and region, this study found no significant evidence of referees favoring fencers from their own region. The p-values for foil, epee, and saber were 0.437, 0.831, and 0.404 respectively. The lack of compelling evidence for regional favoritism in referees' decisions, despite the inherent subjectivity in officiating fencing bouts, might encourage a re-assessment of similar assumptions in other sports. These findings challenge the common assumption of regional bias in sports officiating and highlight the need for further research into the factors influencing referee decision-making. 

#### Fielding Uncertainty: Using Probabilistic Bayesian Neural Networks to Predict MLB Batting Averages 

##### Alee Marschke, Goucher College

<strong>Abstract:</strong> This research project aims to apply a new machine learning technique in the context of predicting MLB batting averages. Probabilistic Bayesian neural networks are a new machine learning technique that attempts to account for both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty by using Bayesian methods. Epistemic uncertainty is addressed with a Bayesian neural network by choosing weights for a neural network from a distribution, allowing there to be different outputs for the same input. Aleatoric uncertainty is accounted for with a probabilistic Bayesian neural network - which outputs a distribution of values. Confidence intervals can be constructed from this distribution to provide a range of values for the response variable. In the context of this application, we can obtain a confidence interval for a player’s batting average in the following season. These three methods (standard neural network, Bayesian neural network, and probabilistic Bayesian neural network) will all be compared to evaluate their effectiveness and usefulness when predicting a player’s batting average for the following year. 

#### Evaluating Player Performance Within the 50 Largest Contracts in MLB History 

##### Stephen Parziale, Yale University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Major League Baseball (MLB) is heavily populated with player contracts exceeding $100,000,000. The purpose of this project is to analyze the player performance within the 50 most valuable contracts signed in MLB history. Overall player performance will be compared with the year prior to signing each contract, to the first year the player played under that new contract. We hypothesize that due to strong monetary incentive in the final year before free agency, player performance in the year prior to the new contract will be stronger than the first-year performance under the new contract. In this project, average WAR in Contract Years and First Years will be estimated, and we will test if there is a significant difference in these values while adjusting for other confounding variables. We will also analyze secondary measures of interest. 

#### SHOULD TEAMS “GO-FOR-IT” MORE ON FOURTH DOWN 

##### Chris Schoborg, University of Central Florida

<strong>Abstract:</strong> If you watched a game on ESPN in the year 2023 at some point in time the team had the ball on their opponent's side of the field on fourth down and the announcer said something like “ESPN analytics says they should go-for-it at this point”. Other than telling you that it was according to ESPN analytics no other information on why or how they came up with this is discussed. In this paper, we will use XGBoost to determine when a team should go-for-it.  The term go-for-it is a football term in which a team on fourth down attempts to gain a first down instead of attempting a field goal or punting the ball. This is seen as a risky choice currently and coaches that follow these analytics are seen as gamblers or unconventional, however as we will present in this paper, we will show why this should be the standard at many times. The remainder of this paper will be laid out as follows: Section 1 presents a literature review of previous work done on this and similar topics, Section 2 is a discussion about the data used for this paper, Section 3 discusses the methodology used to build the model that is used to determine when a team should try for a first down, Section 4 provides the results of our model including some specific examples from our data where a team should have gone for it and full discussion of why, finally the conclusions and limitation can be found in Section 5. 

#### Evaluating MLB Umpire Performance using Statistical Period-Constrained Neural Networks 

##### Adam Slivinsky, University of California, Santa Cruz

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Our research responds to the growing need for a statistically robust approach to estimate the called strike zones of MLB umpires, and introduces a novel metric towards evaluating umpire accuracy. Previous research on this topic does not provide both the explicit representation of a flexible estimated strike zone and uncertainty quantification for the estimation. To advance beyond existing methodologies, we develop a period-constrained random weight neural network to learn the probability of a called strike on any location inside and around the rectangular MLB strike zone. Our model provides competitive out-of-sample prediction error when compared with previously used models. Bayesian inference is used in model fitting, which permits uncertainty quantification for the contour line. By utilizing polar coordinates, we derive an explicit form of the contour line, which facilitates the measuring of umpire accuracy through comparison with the MLB strike zone. By employing novel metrics to assess umpire accuracy, we can evaluate and compare umpire performance league wide, inform decisions about crucial game assignments and contribute to the ongoing dialogue on fair play in baseball. 

#### PAVing the Way for the Future - A Model That Determines Player Value and Evaluates Trades in the National Football League 

##### Atul Venkatesh, Dartmouth College

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Evaluating player performance is one of the most critical concepts in pro football. One method to do so is Approximate Value (AV), where players are given a seasonal score based on accolades and statistics that accumulate throughout their careers. While AV reflects a player's performance historically, it lacks insight into their current worth. To address this issue, AV has been modified to create the Present AV (PAV) statistic, which shows the current value of over 2000 players through the 2023 NFL season. Along with PAV, there is also a draft value chart that gives the expected PAV for every draft pick. With both of these metrics, it is now possible to evaluate past trades, determine the appropriate draft compensation for a player, and use a statistics-based method to determine the most valuable players in the league. While the original version of this paper contained player value grades through the 2022 season, this poster presentation includes an updated version through the 2023 season and a new ordinary least squares regression model to account for age. Was the Stefon Diggs/Justin Jefferson trade really a win/win? How much value would it take to trade for Patrick Mahomes? This presentation seeks to answer both questions and more. 

#### Rebound valuation in expected goals modeling 

##### Jacqueline Wang, Yale University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Expected goals (xG) measure the quality of a shot as a scoring opportunity based on information from past shots. Using play-by-play data from the Professional Women's Hockey Players Association (PWHPA) with rebound locations, we model the probability of a rebound given the initial shot’s location in hockey, finding that shots from the inner slot are better in terms of the value of the rebound that may be generated from that shot. We then create a model which gives credit to initial shots for the rebound value generated. Comparing this to typical xG models, the largest difference occurs in the inner slot where more frequent and higher value rebounds occur.

Visualizing the location of passes leading directly to shot attempts shows that passes leading to high danger shots in terms of xG primarily originate from near the goal line, while those leading to low danger shots primarily originate from the point. As a next step, previous pass location may be a meaningful predictor to add to xG modeling. 

#### Are MLB MVP Award Voters Getting Better? 

##### Ben Wiita, Fitchburg State University

<strong>Abstract:</strong> Every season since 1911 Major League Baseball has handed out two Most Valuable Player Awards, and since 1931 the award has been voted on by members of the Baseball Writers Association of America. The definition of "Most Valuable" the BBWAA gives isn't specific, but it is generally agreed that it's given to the best player. There has long been a sentiment among baseball fans that a lot of the earliest winners of this award might have been undeserving of the award when held under the scrutiny of modern statistics and perspectives. My project is about using statistical tools to determine whether the members of the BBWAA are getting better about selecting the most valuable player in both the American and National League every season. I did this by dividing the game into three phases, offense, defense, and base running. By using the selected stats from each facet of the game has a value at the end that is added together to get the player’s overall value score. I will compare who has the highest data score with the actual winner of the award. Pitchers were not included this study, because the way they impact the game is different from position players. When a pitcher wins MVP, the results are compared to the highest placing position player. Results suggest that voters tend to choose a player with a higher value score more often as years pass by.
