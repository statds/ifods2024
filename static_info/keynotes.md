#### 题目: 经济系统数字孪生

摘要: 一个系统的数字孪生是基于系统模型和观测数据的融合的高精度数值仿真，其代表对该系统认知的最高境界。我将讨论建立中国经济系统数字孪生的重要性和可行性，及对高时空分辨率的经济数据集与建立大计量统计模型的要求。

#### Title: First Principles of Advanced Data Analysis: the Prediction Principle

Abstract: This era of big data is fascinating for data analysis in particular and statistics in general. It has also clearly revealed more than ever different scientific attitudes toward data analysis and statistical research from different perspectives. As statisticians, we see both challenges and responsibility for foundational developments in both statistical inference and scientific modeling. This talk introduces a new principle, called the prediction principle. We argue that this principle can serve as a first principle for valid and efficient inference by exploring its implications in three key research directions: 

&emsp;&emsp;(a) how the prediction principle can be used to refine both the principle of maximum likelihood and the likelihood principle,

&emsp;&emsp;(b) how statistical inference should be formalized, as the required reasoning is deductive, and

&emsp;&emsp;(c) how a general theory of scientific modeling might be achievable, despite the inherent challenges of inductive reasoning.

These discussions are illustrated using seemingly simple but unsolved problems in high-dimensional statistics and deep learning models. To prompt deeper reflections, the talk concludes with a few challenging problems.


Introduction: Chuanhai Liu earned his master's degree in Probability and Statistics from Wuhan University in 1987 and his PhD in Statistics from Harvard University in 1994. He worked at Bell Laboratories for ten years starting in 1995 and at Texas A&M as an Associate Professor in Spring 2024. Since 2005, he has been a Professor of Statistics at Purdue University. His research interests include the foundations of statistical inference, statistical computing, and applied statistics. Much of his work on iterative algorithms, such as Quasi-Newton, EM, and MCMC methods, is discussed in his book titled "Advanced Markov Chain Monte Carlo Methods" (2010), co-authored with F. Liang and R. J. Carroll. His work on the foundations of statistical inference, developing a new inferential framework for prior-free probabilistic inference, is included in his book titled "Inferential Models: Reasoning with Uncertainty" (2015), co-authored with R. Martin. For his research on statistical computing, he spent several years experimenting with a multi-threaded and distributed R software system called SupR for big data analysis. Currently, he is working on topics for a new book titled "Scientific Modeling: : Principles, Methods and Examples."
