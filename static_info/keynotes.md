#### Title: Designing the Optimal Figure Skating Program: Leveraging Data for a Competitive Edge

Abstract: As figure skating continues to evolve into an increasingly
complex and competitive sport, athletes and coaches face the
challenging task of designing optimal, high-scoring program layouts
that will offer a competitive edge. This complexity is driven by the
need to balance technical difficulty with artistic expression, all
while adhering to strict judging criteria. To demystify this process
and aid in strategic planning, we embarked on an analysis of figure
skating performances and elements, including jumps, spins, and step
sequences. Our analysis involves a dataset comprising over 12,000
elements from various elite international competitions, collected from
official scoresheets. Employing regression and Bayesian methods to
evaluate jump success probabilities, as well as mixed-effects
regression models to predict score outcomes, we evaluated variables
encompassing jump types, sequences, scores, and performance
contexts. We were able to identify important predictors of jump
success, as well as predict scores to develop a model capable of
determining the most advantageous jump layouts and element sequences,
providing actionable insights for skaters to plan their programs.

Nathan Chen is a senior at Yale University, majoring in Statistics and
Data Science. He is the 2022 Olympic champion, 2018 Olympic bronze
medalist, three-time World champion, and six-time U.S. national
champion in men’s figure skating. He has been recognized on the
Time100 and in the Forbes 30 Under 30 list for his skating
achievements. At Yale, he works at the Cardiovascular Research Center,
analyzing genomic data to better understand the impact of variants of
known and uncertain significance on cardiovascular outcomes. In his
free time, he enjoys spending time with family and friends, exploring
new food and drink spots, and relaxing anywhere with a nice view.

#### Interdisciplinary Data-Driven Approach to Improve Player Recovery and Performance

Abstract: The integration of statistics, engineering, and biomechanics
has fostered substantial contributions and advancements in sports
science. The strategic incorporation of these disciplines has yielded
novel data collection designs, launched new athletic performance
metrics, and identified new methods for assessing and visualizing
mechanistic changes in motor control during sport specific tasks. This
talk will explore how this interdisciplinary approach has contributed
to the development of innovative treatment protocols, injury risk
assessment practices, and training programs to enhance and improve
sports performance. The state-of-the-art technology used to conduct
sports-based studies will be highlighted to further illustrate how
data analytics and musculoskeletal modeling can help drive player
recovery and on-field performance.

Kristin Morgan is an Assistant Professor of Biomedical Engineering at
the University of Connecticut. Kristin’s work focuses on implementing
innovative gait protocols and musculoskeletal modeling to accelerate
individuals’ rehabilitation progression and improve their long-term
joint health. Notably, she has utilized statistical techniques to
establish universal ranges of healthy dynamics to help characterize
the restoration of healthy biomechanics. Her work has been published
in high-impact journals and has been supported by the Office of Naval
Research, National Science Foundation, General Dynamics Electric Boat,
and the National Institutes of Health.

Technical Product Manager, Zelus Analytics</h4>

#### Baseball Analytics: Past, Present, and Beyond

Abstract: Nearly 50 years after Bill James published his first
Baseball Abstract, statistics has penetrated every corner of America's
favorite pastime, impacting everything from media coverage to team
roster construction through data-driven decision-making.
Join me as we dive into the captivating history and evolution of
Baseball Analytics, the technological changes that took us from box
scores and radar guns to ball tracking and player motion capture. We
will explore the current state-of-the-art, both in the public sphere
and behind the scenes. Drawing inspiration from Keith Woolner's
exploration of baseball's open problems in 2000, we'll also discuss
some of the most intriguing challenges and unanswered questions facing
the industry in the years ahead.
